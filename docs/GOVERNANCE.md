# Governance

## Governance Principles
- Standards are explicit, reviewable, and versioned
- Decisions are documented and attributable
- Exceptions are controlled, time-bound, and reviewable
- Policies prioritize security, reliability, and maintainability

## Decision Cadence
### Weekly
- Review urgent policy questions and active exceptions
- Resolve blockers affecting multiple repositories

### Monthly
- Review proposed standards changes
- Track adoption progress and implementation gaps
- Confirm ownership of open actions

### Quarterly
- Evaluate policy effectiveness and required revisions
- Retire obsolete standards
- Confirm alignment across Exceeds Group and operating companies

## Roles
- Governance maintainers: steward standards and approvals
- Repository maintainers: implement and enforce standards locally
- Contributors: propose and refine standards changes

## Exception Handling Process
1. Submit an exception request including scope, rationale, risk, and duration.
2. Assign an owner and mitigation plan.
3. Governance maintainers review and approve, reject, or request revision.
4. Approved exceptions must include expiration date and review checkpoint.
5. Expired exceptions are either renewed with justification or closed.
