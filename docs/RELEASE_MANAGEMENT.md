# Release Management

## When to Release
Create a release when:
- A set of approved standards changes is ready for adoption
- A policy update affects multiple teams or repositories
- Governance updates require explicit communication and version tracking

## What Requires a Version Bump
- Any merge that changes normative guidance
- Any update that alters compliance expectations
- Clarification-only changes should still be versioned as `PATCH`

## Release Note Structure
Each release note should include:
- Version and release date
- Summary of changed documents
- Change classification (`MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`)
- Required actions for maintainers (if any)
- Effective date for mandatory enforcement (if applicable)
