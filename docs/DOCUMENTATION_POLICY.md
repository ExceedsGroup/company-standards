# Documentation Policy

## Required Documents Per Repository
Each governed repository should include at minimum:
- `README.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `LICENSE`
- Repository-specific operational documentation as needed

## Writing Style Rules
- Use direct and unambiguous language
- Separate requirements from recommendations
- Keep sections short and scannable
- Avoid promotional or speculative statements

## Update Discipline
- Documentation must be updated in the same change as policy or behavior updates
- Broken references or outdated instructions must be corrected promptly
- Periodic documentation reviews should be scheduled at least quarterly
